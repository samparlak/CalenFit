// I will rewrite the file content carefully to include everything correctly or use append if I could but I must overwrite or replace.
// Since the file is large, I'll use replace_file_content to append to the end.

// and the previous tool call failed because of that.
// I will use write_to_file to overwrite the whole file, but I need the full content.

// Let's match the last block "FEEDBACK" and replace it with "FEEDBACK + AUTH".
